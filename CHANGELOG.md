All notable changes to Dailygraph are documented here.
Format: `[version] — date — description`

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Journal card text wrapping** — On smaller screens, "0 entries · Created Mar 31, 2026" was wrapping mid-sentence (e.g. "2026" spilling to the next line). Fixed by splitting into two lines: entry count on line 1, created date on line 2. Changed separator from `" · "` to `"\n"` in `ProfileAdapter.bind()`. Added `lineSpacingExtra="2dp"` to `tvProfileMeta` in `item_profile.xml` for readability.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-30

### Changed
- Bumped `versionCode` 1 → 2, `versionName` "1.0" → "1.0.1"
- Updated `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` from 34 → 35 (Android 15, required by Google Play from 2026)
- Fixed status bar and navigation bar overlap caused by Android 15's enforced edge-to-edge mode
  (`android:windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement = true` in both light/dark themes)
- Added release signing config in `app/build.gradle.kts` (keystore at `../release-keystore.jks`)

### Distribution
- Submitted to Google Play Store (closed testing / Alpha track) — package `com.dailygraph.app`
- Privacy policy published at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amishounak/Dailygraph/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
- GitHub release created with sideload APK

### Known Limitation
- **Signing conflict**: Users who have the Play Store version installed cannot directly install the sideload APK over it. Google Play App Signing uses a different key than the sideload APK. Users must export journals → uninstall → install APK → import journals.

### Play Store Status (as of 2026-04-01)
- Track: Closed Testing (Alpha) — **Active**
- Release: 2 (1.0.1) — approved and live
- Countries: 177
- Testers: Shounak email list (5 emails as of 2026-04-01)
- 14-day countdown starts once 12+ testers opt in
